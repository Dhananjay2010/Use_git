Steps to add code to gitHub:

    git --version === > To check the version of the git installed.

    Steps:
        1. git init

            1.1 ==> If possible change the branch to master
    
        2. git remote add origin (url of the repository created)

            git remote remove origin==> agar galti se galat url dal diya to remove karne ke liye.

          2.1 If you created the readme.md and .gitignore while creating a repository, then 
                to fetch them from cloud

                git pull origin master

        3. git add .(Tells us about the changes performed)
        4. git status ==> To check the status(Not compulsory)
        5. git commit -m "message"
        6. git push origin master

Note :  

    1. If you want to upload a code which already has readme.md and .gitignore file then don't create them while making a repository.
        Otherwise error will be created.

    2. if there are two folders that have different node modules then they cannot be uploaded in the same repository.

    3. If you by chance change the name of the gitHub repository, then follow the same above steps.

        pull statement will also be required.
